        <p><strong>Description:</strong> This project involved creating a test plan to verify the functionality and quality of a web-based calculator. The focus was on validating arithmetic operations, operator precedence, error handling, and performance.</p>
        <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> Web-based Calculator Application, Manual Testing Techniques</p>
        <p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Verified compliance with functional requirements, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division</li>
            <li>Tested edge cases like division by zero and operator precedence</li>
            <li>Ensured results displayed within specified performance thresholds</li>
            <li>Created a traceability matrix linking test cases to requirements</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>My Role:</strong> Designed and executed test cases, documented results, and analyzed system performance.</p>
        <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Delivered a detailed test report outlining test results and compliance with requirements.</p>
